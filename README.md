## CoffeeTawk Project
The purpose of this project was to develop ways to improve the supply chain efficiency, and customer experience of a coffee shop in China. The final React app serves as a way to record data between two variables involved in the coffee ordering pick up and process, from which the data can then be analyzed for correlations, which can be translated to possible insights to improve the business.

### App Functions and Overview:
For my React app, I chose to measure the correlation between the drink temperature (hot/cold) and time taken for the order to be completed. The person collecting data chooses the hot or cold option, and then inputs the time taken in the second column. Then, they can hit the submit button and a data table is immediately updated, and the correlation is calculated in real time as more values are put in.
